# Grade-optimizing-genetic-algorithm
A program I wrote for my Computer Science class (COSC 419) for which I was allowed to pick my grade weight for each component in a given range. Used a genetic algorithm to get the optimal grade.
# Weights
For assignments: between 40-60%  
For quizzes / readings: between 10-30%  
For project: between 20-40%
